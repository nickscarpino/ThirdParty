Judge's note: this does not seem to be a full guide

Jollibee's note: Yeah no shit Judge, let's fix that

## Installation
All that is really needed for installation is double clicking on the .dmg for Panda3D, and then using the provided .sh file to install all of the Panda3D dependencies.

To install the dependencies with the shell file:
    cd "directory of the shell file"
    ./install.sh

## Astron
Simply move the astron file into the astron directory within your source directory. Then run the shell file in the darwin folder within the astron folder.
    cd "directory of start-astron-cluster.sh
    ./start-astron-cluster.sh
    ./start-uberdog-server.sh
    ./start-ai-server.sh
